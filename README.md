# Comcast-Customer-Complaints-Analysis
This project has been created to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques using the Comcast customer complaints dataset. In this project, various processes such as text cleaning, word frequency analysis, and topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been performed. Additionally, various visualizations, including a Pareto diagram, have been created to identify the main topics of complaints and their frequencies. The purpose of this project is to analyze Comcast's customer complaints and provide recommendations for improving the company's services.
